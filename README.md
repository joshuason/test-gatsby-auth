# test-gatsby-auth

A little tester that follows alongside the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/).

Also follows alongside Auth0 React tutorial, and various others... lol.

```
TODO:

[x] add Auth0
  [x] add my email to whitelist in Auth0 dashboard
  [x] show error for unwhitelisted accounts
[ ] persist sessions (no loggie-outie on refresh)
```
